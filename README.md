## Project Overview üìñ

This project presents a robust, vision-based system for detecting potholes on road surfaces. Leveraging the state-of-the-art **YOLOv8x** object detection model, this work introduces a novel image processing pipeline featuring **perspective transformation** to significantly enhance detection accuracy. By remapping road images to a "bird's-eye" view, the system improves the identification of small and distant potholes, a critical task for ensuring vehicle safety and advancing autonomous navigation systems.

This project was developed by **Ajay Deep Rawat**, **Tejas Pakhale**, and **Rahul Gupta**.

## Methodology üí°

The core of this project is a sophisticated workflow designed to maximize detection accuracy through a series of image processing and deep learning stages.

### 1. Data Preprocessing
Raw images are cleaned and prepared to ensure they are suitable for the model training pipeline.

### 2. Perspective Transformation (Key Innovation)
A perspective transformation is applied to each image, shifting the viewpoint to a top-down ("bird's-eye") perspective. This innovative step prioritizes the road surface, making distant and smaller potholes appear larger and more distinct, which is crucial for improving detection rates.

### 3. Bounding Box Adjustment
Following the perspective shift, the bounding box annotations for each pothole are automatically recalculated and adjusted to accurately frame the transformed objects.

### 4. Data Augmentation
To build a more robust model and prevent overfitting, various data augmentation techniques are applied, including rotations, scaling, and flipping. This process artificially expands the diversity of the training dataset.

### 5. Model Training and Inference
The **YOLOv8x model** is trained on the enhanced and augmented dataset. The trained model is then used to perform inference on unseen test images, identifying and localizing potholes with high precision.

## Results üèÜ

The system successfully detects potholes under various road conditions. The model outputs the original image with detected potholes highlighted by **green bounding boxes**. Each box includes the label "pothole" and a **confidence score** indicating the model's certainty.

As detailed in the research paper, this method achieves significant gains in **mean Average Precision (mAP)** and other precision-recall metrics when compared to more conventional detection approaches.

### Sample Output
